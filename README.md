# The Game Chooser

## The Project

You want to play but you can't choose a game? Perfect, this is the purpose of this little program! Made in C with Allegro library, it allows you to quickly find something to play when you are hesitating between multiple games.\
It is a quite old project. Thus, the code is not very clean and some files are .cpp while they should be .c, and it is a CodeBlocks project.

## How to install

The Windows binaries can be found in the release section. There is the old and the new versions, both in a different release. They are stored in .zip files that need to be unzipped. You will then find a .exe file that will open the program. If needed, you can change the games by modifying the pictures (but leaving their original names).

## Issue for recompiling

The first version of the game chooser does not seem to compile in the CodeBlocks project. I did not really look at it, but you can find a debug compilation of this version in the release tab.
